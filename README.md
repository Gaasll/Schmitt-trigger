# Social security number 
By using Arduino Uno and a breadboard, the goal is to get my social security number displayed on a 7-segment display.

**Starting at zero**
- Connection of the 4-bit counter and adder.
- Connecting the 74HC161 4 bit counter, 74HC86 XOR and the 74HC283 4-bit full adder as the figure shows. 
- Connecting the Schmitt trigger clock to the Clock input. 
- Adiiing the 7 Segment Display and connecting it to the CD4543B 7 Segment Decoder.
